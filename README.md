## Gameplay Mechanics

### Game Start
1. When a game starts, all players are teleported to spawn points
2. A 5-second countdown begins
3. After the countdown, players receive snowballs and the game starts
4. Boundary is automatically calculated based on spawn point distances

### During Gameplay
- Players score points by hitting other players with snowballs
- When hit, players are temporarily teleported high in the air and then to a random spawn point
- Players automatically regenerate snowballs over time (up to 16)
- Players must stay within the boundary or risk point penalties
- Visual indicators show which players are close to winning
- Current scores can be viewed using the `/score` command

### Winning
- The first player to reach the target number of hits wins
- The winner is teleported to the winner spot
- Other players are teleported to the loser spot
- Victory fireworks and effects celebrate the winner

## Advanced Features

### Automatic Middle Point Calculation
- The plugin automatically calculates the center point of the arena based on spawn points
- The middle point is used for boundary calculation and respawn mechanics
- No manual setup required - just create your spawn points!

### Threat System
Players who are one hit away from winning are:
- Highlighted with a warning icon (âš ) on the scoreboard
- Given a glowing effect visible to all players
- Marked with red particles and warning fireworks
- If a "threat" player is hit, they lose one point

### Boundary System
- Automatically calculated based on spawn point distances
- Visual warnings when approaching the boundary
- Point penalties for going too far outside the boundary

### Visual Effects
- Colorful particle trails follow snowballs in flight
- Custom effects for hits, respawns, and other events
- Victory fireworks for the winner
- Countdown effects when starting the game

## Data Storage

Game configuration data is stored in the following files in the plugin's data folder:
- `spawnpoints.json`: Player spawn point locations
- `loserspot.json`: Loser teleport location
- `winnerspot.json`: Winner teleport location

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Game won't start  
**Solution**: Use `/gameStatus` to check if all required locations are set and if there are enough players/spawn points

**Issue**: Players falling through the ground after respawn  
**Solution**: Ensure spawn points are on solid ground with at least 2 blocks of clearance above

**Issue**: Scoreboard not showing properly  
**Solution**: Try ending the game with `/endGame` and starting a new game

**Issue**: Players can't hit each other  
**Solution**: Ensure players are in adventure mode (the plugin should do this automatically)

## Planned Features

- Custom snowball types with special effects
- Team-based gameplay
- Custom arena templates
- Configurable game parameters
